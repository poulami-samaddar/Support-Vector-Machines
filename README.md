# Support-Vector-Machines

This section includes two classification projects using  Support Vector Machines (SVM) completed during Udemy course (Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Boot camp) taught by Jose Portilla.

## Project 1: Breast Cancer Classification using SVM
The breast cancer data is imported from sklearn.datasets. The objective is to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using features obtained from several cell images. 
At first SVM model is trained with default ‘C’ and ‘gamma’ values. Later a grid search is performed to obtained optimum parameters. 


## Project 2: Iris flower classification using SVM

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. This data set is imported from seaborn dataset.
The three classes in the Iris dataset:
* Iris-setosa (n=50)
* Iris-versicolor (n=50)
* Iris-virginica (n=50)

The four features of the Iris dataset:
* sepal length in cm
* sepal width in cm
* petal length in cm
* petal width in cm

The job is to classify the data set into three different classes using the features. In this project also grid search is performed to obtained optimum parameters.
